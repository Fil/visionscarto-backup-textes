Jacques-François Cox (1898-1972) is a Belgian astronomer, who will become rector of the Free University of Brussels (ULB). In 1935, he describes, in the {Bulletin de la Classe des Sciences} published by the Royal Academy, a “representation of the entire surface of the earth in an equilateral triangle.”

Three years later, Joseph Antoine Magis, who works as a computer at the Royal Observatory of Belgium, offers a formula and numerical tables that allow its precise computation with the means of the times.

He suggests an application, to draw the Gulf stream:

This projection is {conformal}, meaning that it preserves the angles:  two paths that cross on the planet with a certain angle are represented on the plane with the same angle.

This is made at the expense of surfaces, which as a consequence cannot be equivalent. But, as Magis notes, the area distorsion is less, in the central region of the map, than it is on the traditional conformal projections (Mercator's, Lambert's). {“Though it was imagined as a way to solve a theoretical problem,} concludes Magis, {this canvas therefore has a practical interest in mathematical geography for the proper representation of equatorial regions, notably for Insulindia and for the Belgian Congo.”} However, the complexity of the necessary computations will in practice prohibit its use.


In 1976, Laurence Patrick Lee, computer at the [Department of Survey and Land Information->https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Survey_and_Land_Information] of New Zealand, drawing on the work of the American geographer Oscar S. Adams, publishes a mathematical tour de force in which he proposes a general approach for conformal projections on the Platonic solids (the tetrahedron, the cube, etc). His article, more than a hundred pages long, warrants a special issue of the scientific journal {Cartographica}. He shows how some of these projections are linked to one of [Dixon's elliptic functions->https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixon%27s_elliptic_functions] named {sm}, and produces numeric tables.

In 2011, the mathematician and computer science researcher Malcolm Douglas McIlroy introduces a more precise computation method, based on two Taylor series. This method is the one that we are currently implementing for [d3.js->https://bl.ocks.org/Fil/1aafd8fa22b62243290674384c364dd0].

In a classical view, ignoring Antarctica:

Here is the North aspect, which looks a bit grotesque:

By assembling several of these triangles, one can obtain interesting wallpaper or tiling effects.
